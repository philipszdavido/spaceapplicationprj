The application is about ranking items by letting people vote.

Every voter has chosen 5 items out of a list.
The input is a csv file: headers are | timestamp | voter name | item1 | item2| item3| item4| item5

The output should be an ordered list of the items, from most votes to least votes, with for each item a line with: the item, how many votes it got, who voted for it.
